## collection of tensorflow projects and training code (neural networks, CNNs, etc.)
1. MNIST Neural Network
* Overview: neural network for recognition of handwritten numerical images (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
* Data Source: uses the MNIST data set of 70,000 labeled images from US census handwriting samples

2. CNN (in progress)
